          <p>
            I'm a software engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable, 
            user-focused applications. My background in Biochemistry and Cellular and 
            Molecular Biology from the University of Tennessee gives me a unique 
            analytical perspective on complex technical challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had the privilege of working at innovative companies like Vimeo and 
            Medidata Solutions, where I've led teams, mentored engineers, and delivered 
            systems that serve millions of users. I'm passionate about clean architecture, 
            performance optimization, and creating technology that makes a real difference.
