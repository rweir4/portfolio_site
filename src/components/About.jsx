          <p>
            I'm a software engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable, 
            user-focused applications. I've had the privilege of working at innovative companies like Vimeo and 
            Medidata Solutions, where I've led teams, mentored engineers, and delivered 
            systems that serve millions of users. I'm passionate about clean architecture, 
            performance optimization, and creating technology that makes a real difference.

            Studying Molecular Biophysics at the University of Tennessee taught me how to look at 
            complex systems through both a scientific and computational lens. In the lab, 
            I learned how to break down intricate biological processes into models and experiments. 
            Today, I apply that same approach to engineering—dissecting problems, identifying patterns, 
            and building solutions that work at scale. It’s a perspective that helps me bring both 
            rigor and creativity to technical challenges.
